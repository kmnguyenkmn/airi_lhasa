        <div class="about-content">
          <p>Airi was born on January 25th, 2016, but I didn't have her until April 13th, 2016.  Her name means "precious jasmine" in Japanese, which I believe is very fitting for her. While I did not adopt her from a rescue, I do not regret having her at all. Although I felt cheated given that I was told one price then it jumped by a couple hundred bucks, not to mention the amount of stuff I spent that she didn't really need... I will not name the place I got her at because I do not want to face any repercussions from bad mouthing them. I will say this: when I get myself another dog, I will make sure to research a reputable rescue. Driving with her on the way home, she was trembling. I think she knew she was finally going home, but the ride was scarier than the destination. It surprised me that no one else had picked her up, though her price tag might have played a role into that. Either way, I was happy she was coming home with me. She had her little sheep and chew bone toy as she laid next to my mom's husband.</p>

        <div class="about-content">
          <p>Airi loves playing with other dogs, but she has a very soft spot for people, children especially. While sometimes it's difficult for her to comprehend boundaries, she always wants to show how much she loves the person or maybe she simply wants to be pampered. As mentioned earlier, she can be overprotective, but she's all bark, no bite (let's hope it stays that way). Once she sniffs them out, Airi immediately wants to be friends with people. In regards to children, she is instantly drawn to them. Whenever my nieces and nephews are in town, Airi dashes towards them while she's wagging her tail like a helicopter. Aside from myself, Airi absolutely loves her grandma. Every time she sees grandma (my mom), Airi goes nuts. Despite being 4 years old, she still acts like a puppy. It absolutely cracks me up, it even brings a smile to my mom's face since she's not too fond of animals. Airi worked her charm and is considered one of the grandkids.</p>

        <div class="about-content">
          <p>I will not lie: she is a stubborn girl. That's definitely a trait that is commonly found in her breed. Especially when it comes to taking her outside to do her business when it's raining. Yet, she'll go in the snow, which is frozen water essentially... Airi is just quirky like that. I always say "it's a Lhasa thing" or a more common term, "Lhasatude." I think my grumpiness and flat facial expression rubbed off on her. Even though she gets excited, she doesn't really smile, just like me. Many other Lhasa Apso owners I meet on Facebook and Instagram agree it's a common trait of this breed. They have an attitude. At least she doesn't "back" talk me, she just thinks I'm playing with her when I get onto her. Airi is a good girl and I wouldn't trade her for the world. She's also the closest I'll ever have in terms of children. I hope that I can get her another sibling so that when I'm away from home, she'll have someone to keep her company. I'll likely get a different breed, but on the off chance I can adopt another Lhasa Apso, I will. After all, Airi is the reason I started falling in love with her breed in the first place.</p>
